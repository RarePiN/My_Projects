# Hello, 
you probably come from my Insta Profile.
Heres a brief introduction of myself.

I study in LKKC and thats likely why you are following me on Insta.

I study ICT, Chemistry and Physics.
Do not suggest choosing these subject if you are going to.
And too late if you already chose these subject.

I type funny programs 24/7 in front of my monitor.
I code C ++ , Python3 and a little bit of html.

You can check out what dumb projects I have coded in this Github Repositories.
Some of them might be a little skettchy.
Download it at your own risk :)

By the way, don't ask me about any programming question, I don't know them either.

Yeah, thats all of it.
Have a good day!
